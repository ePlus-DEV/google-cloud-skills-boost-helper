# INSTALL

## Chromium

1. Download and unzip the `google-cloud-skills-boost-helper-{version}-chrome.zip` ([latest release desirable](https://github.com/ePlus-DEV/google-cloud-skills-boost-helper/releases)).
2. Rename the unzipped directory to `google-cloud-helper`.
   - When you update manually, replace the **content** of the `google-cloud-helper` folder with the **content** of the latest zipped version. This ensures all extension settings are preserved.
   - As long as the extension loads from the same folder path as it was originally installed, your settings will be kept.
3. Open Chromium/Chrome and go to _Extensions_.
4. Click to enable _Developer mode_.
5. Click _Load unpacked extension..._.
6. In the file selector dialog:
   - Select the `google-cloud-helper` directory you created.
   - Click _Open_.

The extension will now be available in your Chromium/Chromium-based browser.

**Note:** You must update manually. For some users, manual updates are beneficial because:

- You can update when **you** want.
- If a new version is unsatisfactory, you can easily reinstall the previous one.
